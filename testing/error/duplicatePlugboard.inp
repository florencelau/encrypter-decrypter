* C BETA I VI IV BNMG (LC) (CK)
Wise men say only fools rush in
But I cant help falling in love with you
Shall I stay
Would it be a sin
If I cant help falling in love with you
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
For I cant help falling in love with you
