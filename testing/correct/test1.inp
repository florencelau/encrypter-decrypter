Hey I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and thats an issue
But Im OK
Hey you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them
Again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a brokedown car
And four years no calls
Now youre looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I I I I I cant stop
No I I I I I cant stop

So baby pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you cant afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We aint ever getting older
